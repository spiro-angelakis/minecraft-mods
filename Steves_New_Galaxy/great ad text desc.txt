Steve's New Galaxy is a very challenging modpack.

We have a ton of community-picked mods such as Steve's Universe, Steve's Wasteland, Mekanism, Thermal Expansion, Tinkers Construct, Simply Jetpacks, Shrink, Applied Energistics 2, Compact Machines, Cosmetic Armor, Extreme Reactors, IronChest, JourneyMap, Immersive Engineering, Industrial Foregoing, MineColonies, MowziesMobs, ComputerCraft, Modular Powersuits, Rats, and even magic mods like Ice & Fire, Mahoutsukai, Occultism, Biomancy, and Eilodon, but some mods are gated behind completing their related questlines.
Earth is a very hostile post-apocalyptic wasteland, you can attempt to save it and rebuild for the better and help other players survive if you'd like, OR you can build up your tech and leave for a new home planet that isnt destroyed, OR you can wreak havoc for other players and destroy the world(s) even further, it's all up for you to decide. It's your galaxy now.

The public server for Steve's New Galaxy is always online at:
SERVER IP: play.stevesnewgalaxy.com
ALTERNATE SERVER IP (same as above): SNG.TO.US
