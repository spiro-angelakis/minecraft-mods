SERVER RULES:

1: Be decent. It's fine to attack other players and share some banter, but do not be overly mean to anyone. Have some respect and remember we're all here to have a good time.

2: Should be common sense: No IRL threats, no bullying, no cheats/hacks.

This is supposed to be a challenging PVP server, so expect to get killed many times by other players, you may be robbed of your items at any time, your team mates may turn on you, or you could even get your base blown up by another players ICBM. If you play smart, you could become rich very quickly.
