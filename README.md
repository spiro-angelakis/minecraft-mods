All of the Steve's mods, their workspaces, and their assets, that were originally made for the Steve's New Galaxy modpack using MCreator, reside in this repository.

These mods were removed from Curseforge after the modpack and community was closed down, and after that, until May 21st 2024, no one has had any access to the mods other than what they may have already downloaded.



This repository, the mods within it, and all of their assets, are now under the MIT license, and available to the public.


THESE MODS ARE FREE SOFTWARE, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THEM!




Thank you to everyone in the SNG community that participated over its multiple years of operation, many people helped tremendously, and it was a lot of fun.
